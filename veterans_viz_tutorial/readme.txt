The two data visualization apps in this directory show
how to build simple dynamic data-driven apps based on the

veterans_bar_graph.html builds a dynamic bar chart of
numbers of veterans living in each state.

veterans_table.html shows a dynamic table of numbers of vets
living in each metro area.
